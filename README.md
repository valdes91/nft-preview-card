## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned how to preven content cut off when resizing browser by setting a flex item's margin to auto instead of using justify content on a flex parent:

```css
.container {
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	/* justify-content: center; */
	align-items: center;
}

.card {
	background-color: var(--bg-card);
	padding: 1.5rem;
	border-radius: 15px;
	margin: auto;
	width: 85%;
	max-width: 350px;
}
```

### Continued development

Good experience thinking about reuseable styles. If i want a page with multiple cards, it would help if they all had a default style to them. Thinking about utility styles such as having different padding and margin styles to use on elements instead of applying those styles to every element.

I need more practice on how to create overlays.
